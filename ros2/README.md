# GELLO ROS 2 humble integration

This folder contains all required ROS 2 packages for using GELLO. 
## üîß GELLO: UR_support ([by @JemuelStanley47](https://github.com/JemuelStanley47))
üìÑ For a summary of key commits, check out [`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/JemuelStanley47/gello_software_UR/blob/062f96e46dc89673cbf7a42f7a4e69e284b64f42/CHANGELOG.md)
### Key updates:
- ‚úÖ Maintained the **GELLO-UR integration as a separate ROS 2 (humble) package** (`ur_gello_state_publisher`) to keep it modular. This mirrors the separation in the current Franka support and allows future flexibility (e.g. merging both under a unified package if desired).
- üîÅ Switched from using Dynamixel-based logic (as in the Franka publisher) to the **Gello Agent interface**, which is more flexible and extensible.
- üöÄ I‚Äôm using the `scaled_joint_trajectory_controller` that comes **pre-launched via the official `ur_robot_driver`** ‚Äî no need to set up your own controllers.
- üé• **Verified on URSim and IsaacSim**. 

  Note: The IsaacSim playback appears jerky due to asset tuning issues, not controller performance.  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Gripper integration is **not implemented yet**, but I suggest following a similar structure to the Franka package for that.

### üìÅ Overview of the New Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `gello_publisher.py` | Publishes GELLO joint states and commands to ROS2 topic: `/gello/joint_states`  |
| `gello_to_ur_trajectory.py` | Subscribes to `/gello/joint_states` and publishes `JointTrajectory` to the UR ROS 2 driver |
| `main.launch.py` | Main launch file for the package |
| `send.trajectory.launch.py` | Launch file for the trajectory publisher node |
| `config/gello_config.yaml` | Port-to-joint name mapping, matched to Gello hardware setup |

### Usage:
#### 0. **Prerequisite: Start the UR ROS 2 Driver**

Before launching the GELLO integration, ensure the [official UR ROS 2 driver](https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver/tree/humble) is running and the `joint_trajectory_controller` is active.

Start the UR driver (replace `robot_ip` with your UR robot's IP):

```bash
ros2 launch ur_robot_driver ur_control.launch.py ur_type:=ur5e robot_ip:=192.168.56.101
```

Check that the `joint_trajectory_controller` is active:

```bash
ros2 control list_controllers
```

Expected output should include:

```scss
joint_trajectory_controller        joint_trajectory_controller/JointTrajectoryController         active  
joint_state_broadcaster            joint_state_broadcaster/JointStateBroadcaster                 active  
forward_velocity_controller        velocity_controllers/JointGroupVelocityController             inactive
io_and_status_controller           ur_controllers/GPIOController                                 active  
forward_position_controller        position_controllers/JointGroupPositionController             inactive
<MORE>
```

If it is not active, activate it with:

```bash
ros2 control switch_controllers --activate joint_trajectory_controller --deactivate forward_position_controller forward_velocity_controller
```

#### 1. Launch the gello state publisher
`ur_gello_state_publisher:`
```bash
ros2 launch ur_gello_state_publisher main.launch.py com_port:=/dev/serial/by-id/<usb-FTDI_USB__-__Serial_Converter_<YOUR_DEVICE>>
```
Expected output:
```scss
[INFO] [launch]: All log files can be found below /home/spartan47/.ros/log/2025-06-29-19-11-01-931179-spartan47-135881

[gello_publisher-1] [INFO] [1751238662.822823913] [gello_publisher]: Using publish rate: 250.0 Hz
```
This will publish the gello joint positions on `/gello/joint_states`

#### 2. Launch the joint trajectory publisher
`gello_to_ur_trajectory:`
```bash
ros2 launch ur_gello_state_publisher send.trajectory.launch.py 
```
Expected output:
```scss
[INFO] [launch]: Default logging verbosity is set to INFO
[INFO] [gello_to_ur_trajectory-1]: process started with pid [141861]
[gello_to_ur_trajectory-1] [INFO] [1751240393.074761466] [gello_to_ur_trajectory]: Using joint names from config: ['shoulder_pan_joint', 'shoulder_lift_joint', 'elbow_joint', 'wrist_1_joint', 'wrist_2_joint', 'wrist_3_joint']

## VS-Code Dev-Container

We recommend working inside the provided VS-Code Dev-Container for a seamless development experience. Dev-Containers allow you to use a consistent environment with all necessary dependencies pre-installed. 

To start the Dev-Container, open the `ros2` sub-folder of this repository (not the entire `gello_software` folder) in VS Code. If prompted, select **"Reopen in Container"** to launch the workspace inside the Dev-Container. If you are not prompted, open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and select **"Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"**. Building the container for the first time will take a few minutes. For more information, refer to the [VS-Code Dev-Containers documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).

If you choose not to use the Dev-Container, please refer to the [Local Setup](#local-setup) section below for manual installation instructions.

## Local Setup

### Prerequisites

- **ROS 2 Humble Desktop** must be installed.  
  See the [official installation guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html) for instructions.
- **libfranka** and **franka_ros2** must be installed.  
  Refer to the [Franka Robotics documentation](https://frankaemika.github.io/docs/index.html) for installation steps and compatibility information.
- **ros2_robotiq_gripper** (if required) must be installed.  
  See the [ros2_robotiq_gripper GitHub repository](https://github.com/PickNikRobotics/ros2_robotiq_gripper) for installation and usage instructions.

> üí° **Hint:**  
> You can also find example installation commands for `libfranka`, `franka_ros2`, and `ros2_robotiq_gripper` in the [Dockerfile](./.devcontainer/Dockerfile) located in the `ros2/.devcontainer` directory. These commands can be copy-pasted for your local setup.

### Further Dependency Installations

After installing the prerequisites, you may need to install additional dependencies required by this workspace. For this you can run the `install_workspace_dependencies.bash` script.

If you add new dependencies to your packages, remember to update the relevant `requirements.txt`, `requirements_dev.txt` or `package.xml` files and re-run the script.

## Build and Test

### Building the Project

To build the project, use the following `colcon` command with CMake arguments, required for clang-tidy:

```bash
colcon build --cmake-args -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON -DCHECK_TIDY=ON
```

### Testing the Project

The packages come with a set of tests, which can be executed using the following command:

```bash
colcon test 
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:**  
> All commands for building and testing must be executed from the `ros2` directory of this repository.

## Getting Started

### 1. **Run the GELLO Publisher**  
#### Step 1: Determine your GELLO USB ID
      
To proceed, you need to know the USB ID of your GELLO device. This can be determined by running:

```bash
ls /dev/serial/by-id
```

Example output:

```bash
usb-FTDI_USB__-__Serial_Converter_FT7WBG6
```

In this case, the `GELLO_USB_ID` would be `/dev/serial/by-id/usb-FTDI_USB__-__Serial_Converter_FT7WBG6`.

#### Step 2: Configure your GELLO 
      
If not done already, follow the instructions of the `Create the GELLO configuration and determining joint ID's` section in the main README.md. Use the provided script to configure the GELLO for Franka FR3:

```bash
python3 scripts/gello_get_offset.py \
--start-joints 0 0 0 -1.57 0 1.57 0 \
--joint-signs 1 1 1 1 1 -1 1 \
--port /dev/serial/by-id/<GELLO_USB_ID>
```
      
To apply your configuration:
- Update the `/workspace/src/franka_gello_state_publisher/config/gello_config.yaml` file.
- Rebuild the project to ensure the updated configuration is applied:

```bash
colcon build
```

#### Step 3: Launch the GELLO publisher:  
Launch the GELLO publisher node with the appropriate `com_port` parameter:

```bash
ros2 launch franka_gello_state_publisher main.launch.py com_port:=/dev/serial/by-id/<GELLO_USB_ID>
```

### 2. **Launch the Joint Impedance Controller**  
   
   Launch the controller to send torque commands to the Franka robot:  
   ```bash
   ros2 launch franka_fr3_arm_controllers franka_fr3_arm_controllers.launch.py robot_ip:=<robot-ip> load_gripper:=<true_or_false>
   ```

   - `robot_ip:` Replace `<robot-ip>` with the IP address of your Franka robot.
   - `load_gripper`: A boolean parameter (true or false) that specifies whether to load the Franka Hand:
      - Set load_gripper:=true if you are using the Franka Hand.
      - Set load_gripper:=false if you are not using the Franka Hand.
  
### 3. **Launch the Gripper Manager**
   
   To control the gripper, use the appropriate launch file based on the gripper type:

   - **For the Franka Hand**:  
     ```bash
     ros2 launch franka_gripper_manager franka_gripper_client.launch.py
     ```

   - **For the Robotiq 2F-85**:  
     ```bash
     ros2 launch franka_gripper_manager robotiq_gripper_controller_client.launch.py com_port:=/dev/serial/by-id/<ROBOTIQ_USB_ID>
     ```

     The `ROBOTIQ_USB_ID` can be determined by `ls /dev/serial/by-id`.


## Troubleshooting

### SerialException(msg.errno, "could not open port {}: {}".format(self._port, msg))

The open com port could not be opened. Possible reasons are:
- Wrongly specified, the full path is required, such as: `/dev/serial/by-id/usb-FTDI_***`
- The device was plugged in after the docker container started, re-open the container
  
### libfranka: Incompatible library version (server version: X, library version: Y).

The libfranka version and robot system version are not compatible. More information can be found [here](https://frankaemika.github.io/docs/compatibility.html).
Fix this by correcting the `LIBFRANKA_VERSION=0.15.0` in the [Dockerfile](./.devcontainer/Dockerfile) and update the `FRANKA_ROS2_VERSION` and `FRANKA_DESCRIPTION_VERSION` accordingly.
